Comix Cursors installation instructions
=======================================

Basic Installation
==================

Requirements:
- ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org)
- inkscape (www.inkscape.org)

Download the ComixCursors sources from:

http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=32627

Change into the download directory and unpack the sources:

# tar -xjvf ComixCursours-0.5.0.tar.bz2
# cd ComixCursors-0.5.0

With ImageMagick and inkscape installed
build and install the custom ComixCursors:

# ./install.bash

This will parse the CONFIG and HOTSPOTS files, export the 
cursor source files in the svn directory to PNGs in the 
build directory (using inkscape), assemble and apply some 
effects using ImageMagick tools convert and mogrify, create 
the xcursors in the cursors directory, and install the files
in your ~/.icons directory. 
Not that the shadow images will be cached to reduce building
overhead. The shadow images are stored in the "shadows"
directory created at build time. The files are named 
<name>-<size>-<color>-<transparency>.png and will get used 
by the svg2png.bash script when existing. So if you make in 
sources (e.g. edit the svg files) you might have to clean the
shadows directory: "# rm shadows/*" or "# make clean".


Complete Installation
=====================

To install all the original ComixCursors issue:

# ./install-all

which will process all the configurations in the 
ComixCursorsConfigs directory and install all 42 cursor
sets provided into your ~/.icons directory.


System Installation
===================

For system-wide installation you need to copy the cursor-
directories to you X11 lib directory. As root:

## whereis X11
## man 3 xcursor
# cd /usr/share/icons
# cp -r ~/.icons/ComixCursors* .

Now this will interfere with the cursor theme in your ~/.icons
directory, which will have precedence. You will want to rename
the cursors directory and edit the index.theme file inside. 

If you want to make this theme the system-wide default, edit
the file /etc/sysconfig/windowmanager to read:

X_MOUSE_CURSOR="ComixCursors-White-Regular-Slim"

or whatever you renamed that cursors directory to.


You could also download the rpms from kde-look.org site above
and install them with 
# rpm -Uv ComixCursors-0.5.0-1.noarch.rpm
