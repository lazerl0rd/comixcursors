Comix Cursors installation instructions
=======================================

Basic Installation
==================

Requirements:
- ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/>
- librsvg <http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/>

Download the ComixCursors sources from:

http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=32627

Change into the download directory and unpack the sources:

    $ version=0.6.1
    $ tar -xjvf ComixCursors-${version}.tar.bz2
    $ cd ComixCursors-${version}

When you have the required programs, issue:

    $ ./build-cursors

This will read the basic cursors from the SVG files, add a blurred and
scaled shadow, tint the icons and compose them into a single PNG
image.

After all the images have been processed, you should invoke:

    $ make
    $ make install

to create the xcursor files and install them into you personal cursors
folder (‘$HOME/.icons/’).

Not that some files (e.g. the shadow images) will be cached to reduce
building overhead. So if you make in sources (e.g. edit the svg files)
you might have to clean the working tree:

    $ make clean

If you want to remove the cursor theme from its installed location,
invoke:

    $ make uninstall


Complete Installation
=====================

To install all the original ComixCursors issue:

# ./install-all

which will process all the configurations in the 
ComixCursorsConfigs directory and install all 42 cursor
sets provided into your ~/.icons directory.


System Installation
===================

For system-wide installation you need to copy the cursor-
directories to you X11 lib directory. As root:

## whereis X11
## man 3 xcursor
# cd /usr/share/icons
# cp -r ~/.icons/ComixCursors* .

Now this will interfere with the cursor theme in your ~/.icons
directory, which will have precedence. You will want to rename
the cursors directory and edit the index.theme file inside. 

If you want to make this theme the system-wide default, edit
the file /etc/sysconfig/windowmanager to read:

X_MOUSE_CURSOR="ComixCursors-White-Regular-Slim"

or whatever you renamed that cursors directory to.


You could also download the rpms from kde-look.org site above
and install them with 
# rpm -Uv ComixCursors-0.5.0-1.noarch.rpm
